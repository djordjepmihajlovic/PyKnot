To do: January

- latent space interpretation should be large focus this semester StA and StS 
- tie this in together with decision tree.
- do decision tree analysis on uni comps
- training for StS reconstruction .. will require uni comps get Filippos help
- 2D reconstruction of knots


- Birds eye view of project:

read paper on writhing: "The writhe of open and closed curves" M.A.Berger & Chris Prior

write story of how we motivate need for said latent space dimensions


so far we have built generative techniques to reconstruct StA data accurately with dim*2 min crossing number (TSNE and PCA) -will attempt this for StS near future
want to conduct a very formal analysis and investigation on these latent space.
FORMAL ANALYSIS:
-> want a review of changes along dimensions of latent space .

START WITH: 6D 3 class
then do 10D 5 class
                ________________________________________________
latent dim 0: | (min), (...), (0), (...), (max) -> shows deformation of dimension from same starting point, each graph should have a coloring to indicate what the reultant prediction is
latent dim 1: | (min), (...), (0), (...), (max) 
latent dim 2: | (min), (...), (0), (...), (max)
latent dim 3: | (min), (...), (0), (...), (max)
latent dim 4: | (min), (...), (0), (...), (max)
latent dim 5: | (min), (...), (0), (...), (max)
latent dim 6: | (min), (...), (0), (...), (max)
latent dim 7: | (min), (...), (0), (...), (max)
latent dim 8: | (min), (...), (0), (...), (max)
latent dim 9: | (min), (...), (0), (...), (max)


In addition decision tree models have designed and tested, 
An attempt to train StA to predict dowker code failed X
Attempt to train StS to predict dowker code?
Attempt to train XYZ to predict dowker code?
