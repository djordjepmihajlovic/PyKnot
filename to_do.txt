To do:

Code:

Test GRNY SQR 8_20 (downloaded) (dowker coded/unsigned/tested, 0.9993777871131%) (dowker coded/signed/tested, 0.9995111227036%) 
Test unsupervised prediction -> train (0_1, 3_1, 4_1, 5_1) -> predict 5_2
Test just 7's?
Create some nice graphs!^^

Start looking at how polynomials are calculated...

Figure out structuring --> physics link --> generative methods and dowker code?

- code can get dowker code, so need to create data files with dowker code per knot, 5 class (200 knot configurations)
